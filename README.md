Demo: https://event-spotter-1c607.firebaseapp.com/

Created using React 16.12.0.

## The Project

The Event Spotter is a project developed as a way of practicing my 
studies with React, meaning that no commercial purposes are applied. <br />

Its basic idea is to find events around the world, having the option to filter
them based on their location, dates and category. For this, I used help
from the API listed below.

## API
Ticketmaster API is a discovery API for finding events globally. You can check out
their documentation on https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/ 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
